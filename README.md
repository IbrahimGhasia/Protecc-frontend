# Protecc

Protecc leverages threshold encryption to securely encrypt and store electronic health records(EHR). Patients authenticate with their private key and onboard their health data and basic credentials on Protecc. The platform encrypts and stores these records on-chain in a mutable SQL table format. No one can snoop or modify these encrypted records except for the owner of the EHR. The platform also brings together a network of patients and doctors to setup consultations through a secure, wallet-to-wallet messaging channel. Appointments are set in the dapp and recorded on-chain for doctors to pick suitable time slots. Post consultation, doctors can upload case data via the patient's messaging channel. These cases will be permanently appended to the patient's EHR. Patients always have the exclusive access to grant or revoke view/edit permission to their EHRs from doctors and hospitals. Protecc has been designed for complete privacy and ownership.
